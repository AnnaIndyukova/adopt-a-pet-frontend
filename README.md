# Adopt a Pet

A web application that helps people find and adopt pets from shelters.

Shelters can register on the platform to showcase their animals with detailed profiles, while potential adopters can easily browse pets based on their location and personal preferences. The search feature prioritizes pets from the closest shelters to the user (location feature requires sign-in).

## Key Technologies and Features

- React.js for interactive and dynamic UI
- Geocoding API to convert addresses into coordinates for proximity-based search
- Custom hooks, global context and state management
- Responsive design using media queries to ensure compatibility with various screen sizes
