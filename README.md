#Notes

1. As I have chosen to create a full-stack application, I don't have to deploy the front-end part yet.
2. As I haven't created the backend part yet, the Search button doesn't perform search. It will be using a custom API, which I will create during the next sprints.
3. The reason that the user cannot log in is the same.
