# Notes

Apparently, students and reviewers have different versions of the documentation regarding project deployment. I contacted the manager, and they are now working on correcting the issue. Anyway, I have deployed the frontend part.

# Adopt a Pet - frontend

A web application that helps people pick a pet from a shelter.

Shelters can register to provide information about their animals, and potential pet parents can search according to their preferences. Results will be shown starting with the closest available shelter.
